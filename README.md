# Sumqzs_Multipad
First up sorry for any typos or grammar mistakes. English isn't my primary language but I've tried my best.

My own custom Macropad. It's simple but includes a variety of features. It's supposed to make life with a 60% Keyboard better. To get the space benefit of the small Keyboard but they possibility to add extra buttons and features when needed. This project was made possible by blueprint.hackclub

I made this product following the tutorial on blueprint.hackclub and added my own ideas I've had a lot of fun and will probably be making another project soon.

If anyone wants to build something similar feel free to ask me about the process!
